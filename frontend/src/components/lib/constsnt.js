Voice agents combine speech and reasoning capabilities to enable real-time, human-like conversations. They’re already being used to enhance learning, support customer service, and improve accessibility in healthcare and talk therapy.

In this course, you’ll learn how to build voice agents that listen, reason, and respond naturally. You’ll follow the architecture used to create Andrew Avatar, a collaborative project between DeepLearning.AI and RealAvatar that responds to users in Andrew Ng’s voice. You’ll build a voice agent from scratch and deploy it to the cloud, enabling support for many simultaneous users.

By the end of this course, you’ll have learned the components of an AI voice agent pipeline, combined them into a system with low-latency communication, and deployed them on cloud infrastructure so it scales to many users.`,

The course also incorporates voice technology from ElevenLabs, a supporting contributor to the project.

Voice agents combine speech and reasoning capabilities to enable real-time, human-like conversations. They’re already being used to enhance learning, support customer service, and improve accessibility in healthcare and talk therapy.

In this course, you’ll learn how to build voice agents that listen, reason, and respond naturally. You’ll follow the architecture used to create Andrew Avatar, a collaborative project between DeepLearning.AI and RealAvatar that responds to users in Andrew Ng’s voice. You’ll build a voice agent from scratch and deploy it to the cloud, enabling support for many simultaneous users.

By the end of this course, you’ll have learned the components of an AI voice agent pipeline, combined them into a system with low-latency communication, and deployed them on cloud infrastructure so it scales to many users.`,
